                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>When computer science comes up, I perk up.  Learning about computers isn't just interesting to me, it's captivating. 
                    It's a subject where time melts away as long as I'm acquiring new knowledge.  
                    This fascination stems from my logical and analytical mind, one of my strengths.  
                    I've always been drawn to the intricate workings of computers and their ability to solve problems in multiple ways.  
                    Their constant evolution year after year is truly impressive.</p>

                    <p>My fascination with computers blossomed in elementary school.  
                        Whenever we used the computers in class (unsurprisingly, my favorite subject!), we learned not only how they functioned but also how to build simple models. 
                        We explored block programming with Scratch and delved into the internet.  
                        It wasn't long before my classmates recognized me as the go-to tech person.</p>
                    
                    <p>By middle school, I was helping teachers troubleshoot classroom tech issues and participating in discussions about technology.  
                        I also took a programming class where we learned Visual Basic.  During this time, an event happened that fundamentally changed my perspective on computers.  
                        I encountered a ransomware attack that encrypted my documents, photos, and videos.  While most would find this experience frightening, I was intrigued.  
                        I bombarded myself with questions: How was this possible? How did it work?  Fueled by this curiosity, I started experimenting with code and attempting to create my own programs.  
                        The frustration of encountering bugs and spending weeks on projects without solutions could be disheartening, but it never deterred me.  
                        Instead, it fueled my determination to find a solution.</p> 
                    
                    <p>High school saw me delve into AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) and AP Computer Science (CS).  
                        These courses solidified my understanding of programming fundamentals and its power to create software applications.  
                        The limitless potential of computer science became clear.  To further my knowledge, I ventured beyond the classroom curriculum.  
                        The internet became my learning companion.  
                        I took online coding classes, watched YouTube tutorials showcasing others' work, and devoured articles to stay abreast of the latest tech news.  
                        This exploration solidified my understanding of computer science's importance and its ability to improve lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>The beauty of computer science lies in the constant flow of ideas.  A single person's concept can revolutionize an entire program.  
                        Imagine the possibilities when a group collaborates, each member contributing unique perspectives.  
                        This collaborative spirit fosters a vast array of approaches to problem-solving.  
                        Ultimately, the implementation of computer science benefits everyone, making life easier and more efficient.</p>
