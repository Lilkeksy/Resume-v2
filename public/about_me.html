                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Whenever it gets to computer science, I am all ears. Knowing the concepts of computers not only fascinates me but also compels me. 
                    It is a subject I enjoy so much, one where in its presence, time fades. 
                    This fascination lies in the fact that it appeals to my logical and analytical ability, which is one of my strong points. 
                    In short, I became inspired by their internal mechanisms and how they solve problems in various approaches, evolving year after year, nothing short of awe.</p>

                <p>My interest in computers at the onset of elementary school continued to grow. 
                    Whenever we utilized the computers in class, particularly in what has become my most favored course, we not only studied the ways the computers worked but also ways to construct models of them. 
                    We learned block programming with Scratch and looked at the internet with depth. 
                    Fueled with passion and desire to learn more, it did not take long until my classmates saw me as their technology expert and the one they could run to for solutions.</p>
                
                <p>The height of my interest hit in middle school. I was proactively resolving problems with the classroom technology and participating in the discussion. 
                    During this time, I enrolled in a programming class where we used Visual Basic as our language of study. 
                    We built visual calculators, a tic-tac-toe game, and other fun things. 
                    Fun as it was, little was I aware that what was to come would be the rollercoaster of what I would classify as perhaps the most significant moment in my life.</p>
                
                <p>In my quest for knowledge, A pivotal event that significantly altered my perception of computers occurred when I fell prey to ransomware, which encrypted my documents, photos, and videos. 
                    While many people would panic in such a situation, I felt a sense of curiosity, bombarding myself with questions: 
                    How was this possible? How did it work? Driven by this curiosity, I started experimenting more in-depth with code, trying to achieve things on my own. 
                    Amidst the bugs I would encounter, spending several days without finding a solution. 
                    I was not discouraged, instead, I was motivated and pushed to persevere and find answers.</p>
                
                <p>I did not stop. High school was a year of growth for me as a technologist, taking AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) in my junior year and AP Computer Science (CS) in my senior year. 
                    These courses further cemented my learnings of programming basics and the capability of coding to develop software programs. 
                    The tremendously vast prospects of this subject became apparent. In the quest to expand my knowledge base of the subject matter, I went further than the curriculum. 
                    The internet became my learning partner more than ever. I did online coding lessons, watched videos of other coder’s work; read articles to be aware of new technological developments. 
                    Lastly, this exploration helped me establish the significance of computer science and how it can positively impact people’s lives.</p>
                
                <p>Well, at the moment, I am a university student reading computer science specializing in artificial intelligence. Above all, AI has stimulated my interest more than any other field. 
                    I have had firsthand experience with it, and there is no end to its use. For what can AI not do? 
                    With it, one can diagnose undocumented diseases, develop study plans for students with learning disabilities, and solve the most complex mathematical problems. 
                    There are numerous and highly significant potential AI advantages. I would want to be among the first people to embrace this new age of development and help society.</p>
